# ROS computational graph level

ROS computational graph is where the data is processing in ROS workspace, this concept consist of nodes, Master, Parameter Server, messages, services, topics, and bags. [Here](https://github.com/gmp-prem/BasicROS/blob/main/Images/roscompgraph.png) is the link to full concept diagram, and [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Concepts#:~:text=services%20in%20ROS.-,ROS%20Computation%20Graph%20Level,the%20Graph%20in%20different%20ways.) is the link to full detail of the ros computational graph

## Nodes

Node is the smallest unit in ROS framework that will perform the process for task or tasks. Node can perform 

## Continuous data streams (topics)



## Remote procedure calls (services)
