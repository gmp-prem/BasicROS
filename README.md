## Getting started with Linux
### What is Linux?
[**Linux**](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/) is an open-source Unix-like OS that manages communication between hardward and software, since Linux is an open-source, many distributions(versions) have been developed, one of the most popular one is [**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com/) we use today.

### Ubuntu interface
Desktop elements
  - asd

File system level on ubuntu
  - asd

### Performing tasks on Ubuntu
**Shell** is a command-line interface that interprets what should the ubuntu perform from command of user, there are many shells out there but the default one of ubuntu is Bourne-Again shell or bash

As a developer, most of time we spend on ubuntu doing tasks will use what we called **terminal**, terminal is a power tool that uses shell to interprets the command and it gives us ability to
  - Navigating
  - Manipulating
  - Diagnosis
  - Access other devices
  - More++

You can start using **shell** or **terminal** by go to a launcher and type the following word and enter
```
terminal
```
or the another way is to use the short-cut which is way better and faster, just press `ctrl` + `alt` + `t`
then your terminal should appear as shown below

</p>

You can see that on the terminal there is a `prem@prem:~$`

`prem` is the username indicated before @ symbol

`prem` is the hostname indicated after @ symbol

`~` is the directory you are working on

`$` is prompt symbol, this symbol will just tell where the command you type will begin

Since I said that terminal can be used to do navigating, manipulating, diagnosis, let's see what's it like



### Why Ubuntu on developing Robotics? :fire:
- lightweightness, ubuntu is lightweight in its nature, ypu don't have to pay to get access, you can install along side with your existing operating system, just donwload, install and use!
- the distro of ubuntu is a long-term support (usually 5 years)
- tons of community support, ubuntu has a great community whenever you have a problem, you could get help such as [ubuntu community](https://ubuntu.com/community) or [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and more communities++ out there
